In this project, we will primarily be using these datasets:

    Relevant Twitter dataset from Kaggle (2020)
    Government census data (2016-2020)
        Poverty
        Education
        Employment
        Demographics {population, race and ethnicity, sex and gender, age groups}
        Religion


The Goal: To determine voter breakdown of each county by percentage, thereby determining the popular vote and electoral college outcomes of the 2020 presidential election. 
Reach Goal: Using data from (2020-2024) to predict the popular vote and electoral college outcomes of the 2024 presidential election.

Stakeholders: 
Political Campaign Teams: Interested in understanding potential voting outcomes to strategize campaign efforts
Government Officials: Could be interested in insights for policymaking or understanding public sentiment.

KPIs: 
Accuracy of Predictions: Measure of how accurately our model predicts voting outcomes compared to actual results.
Model Performance Metrics: Evaluation metrics to assess model performance.
Feature Importance: Understanding the impact of different features (e.g., poverty rates, education levels) on the predictions.

The Plan:
We plan to use county level data to determine voting outcomes of 2020, by considering Twitter posts of 2020, and relevant factors such as poverty rate, education level, employment rate, etc, ideally from 2016 to 2020. 

We will attempt to determine the voting breakdown of each county, thereby determining the popular vote and electoral college outcome of 2020.

Time permitting, we will try and predict 2024 outcomes using our model with 2020-2024 data.
